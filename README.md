# **`README.md` Project Planning Boilerplate (Version: 1.0)**

This repository provides a personal collection of standardized Markdown templates and a methodology for kickstarting software development projects.  
It emphasizes structured planning from MVP definition to detailed feature specification, and is designed to be particularly effective for AI-assisted workflows.

While developed for personal use, these templates may serve as a useful reference for others looking to organize their project planning.

## Purpose

To provide a reusable "Project Kickstart Kit" that includes:

- A master `StartPrompt.md` for initiating projects with AI assistants.
- A master `TODO.md` for high-level project roadmapping (MVP, Phase 2+).
- A detailed 10-point `TODO-Example.md` template for granular feature planning.
- A template for defining project-specific `FolderStructure.md`.
- A comprehensive `initProject.md` guide on how to use this boilerplate.

## How to Use
